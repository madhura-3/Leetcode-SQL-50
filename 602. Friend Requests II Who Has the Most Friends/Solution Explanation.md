# Intuition
To find the person with the most friends, we need to count the number of connections for each person. The person with the highest count will have the most friends.

# Approach
1. We can use a common table expression (CTE) to combine the requester and accepter IDs from the `RequestAccepted` table.
2. Then, we count the occurrences of each `ID` to determine the number of friends for each person.
3. Finally, we select the person with the highest count.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity of the query depends on the size of the `RequestAccepted` table and the number of distinct IDs. The process of merging and counting each ID would require iterating through each row at least once, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)**.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity of the query depends on the size of the result set, which is determined by the number of distinct `IDs`. Since we are storing the results of the query temporarily in memory, the space complexity can also be considered as **O(n)**, where n represents the number of distinct IDs.

# Code
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
with results as (
    select requester_id as id, accepter_id
    from RequestAccepted

    union all

    select accepter_id as id, requester_id
    from RequestAccepted
)

select id, count(*)as num
from results
group by id
order by num desc
limit 1;
```

This SQL query finds the person with the most friends by counting the number of connections each person has and selecting the one with the highest count.
